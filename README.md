# INET 4031 Geometry Application

This is a simple small Flask-based web application that calculates the volumes of different 3D shapes. It was created as part of the INET 4031 coursework to learn how Flask works, how HTML templates interact with Python code, and how to deploy Python applications in virtual environments and containers.

## What it does

This is a Dynamic Web Application which contains two types of content:

1. Static content in the form of HTML
2. Dynamic content created by a programming language.

Essentially, the Geometry Calculator lets you choose a shape (sphere or cylinder) and enter its measurements. The app then calculates the volume using the correct math formula. In this application the programming language is Python. 

## What was Learned

This project teaches the basics of building and running a small Flask web application, including how to separate logic into Python modules, how to create and use HTML templates, and how to pass user input from web forms into Python functions. It demonstrates how to organize a simple web app, write and run Python unit tests to verify calculations, and manage the project using a virtual environment so the system stays clean. It also introduces working with GitHub, using a proper .gitignore, and understanding how applications can run both locally and inside containers on a VM.
